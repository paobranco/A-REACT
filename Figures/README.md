# This folder contains results and plots

There are two .xlsx files for each one of the 8 datasets.
The naming convention of the xlsx file is as follows:
<AL_type>_<Dataset_Name>_new, where 
 - <AL_type> refers to the AL strategy used (UnS: Uncertanty sampling; QBC)
 - <Dataset_Name> is the dataset used
 - new means that A-REACT was used
